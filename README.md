# Zim-Corona-Cases

The analysis is based on the Zimbabwe corona cases between 20 March- 7 March 2020. This data was extracted from the WHO website on the 8th of July 2020.
The automated ARIMA model AKA Hyndman Khandakar algorithm is employed and forecasts averaging 21 cases per day are obtained. The increase in cases could be due to the loosened travel restrictions, movement to exammination points and porous measures in the quarantine sites.
